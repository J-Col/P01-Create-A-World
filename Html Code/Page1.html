        <p>
          A blinding light flashes before your eyes and you are
          transported to an unknown world. You appear to be flying
          yet your body is no where to be found, almost as if it were
          a dream. From your bird's eye view you can see that you are above
          a coast, with rolling hills expanding beyond your field of view.
          There appears to be a primitve settlement of people along the coast.
          After a brief head count, there can't be anymore than one hundred
          people. You have two options, attempt to help them expand by
          flatening the land behind them; or help them learn how to live
          off the ocean.
