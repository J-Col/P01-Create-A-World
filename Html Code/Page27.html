          The villagers all load on to two boats, enough supplies to last five
          years at sea. They travel with the winds and the current of the ocean,
          with no knowledge of the ocean they are at the complete mercy of
          nature. They eventually encounter a storm and one boat it capsized.
          The other is badly damaged, and barrely escapes destruction.
          Unfortunately, it loses most of its food for the journey, and people
          begin to starve in the following year. Eventually each member of the
          ship dies of starvation and the boat floats aimlessly through the sea,
          never seen again.
