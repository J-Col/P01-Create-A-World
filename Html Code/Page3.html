        <p>
          With your mighty power of the seas you force the sands to come together
          and meld creating a sand bar. The seas recede revealing your creation
          to the people and they are stunned. The sand is stil settling so it
          appears as if the land is shifting and turning each second. This land
          mass is never before seen despite their multiple trips into the sea.
          The most adventurous of the village begin to take their first steps on
          to the new mass.
