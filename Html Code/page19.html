          Without changing their habits the village continues on with its life.
          Everything is fine for a few years until the crops stop growing all
          together. The soil changes from its once dark color and wet texture
          to a light brown and dry feeling. Nothing will grow anymore and without
          their main food source the village soon begins to starve. Some resort
          to cannibalism to survive and the village is eventually destroyed.
