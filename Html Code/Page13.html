          The villagers ask you how to create a council where people can
          propose ideas and vote for a decision. After explaining the basic
          concept to the village they appear to understand it much better
          than you had anticipated. They quickly adopt the system and begin to
          make changes toward improving the village. They create new technologies
          that you didn't know they were capable of through experimentation and
          sharing of thoughts during council. They are more than cappable of
          surviving now and you feel as if your work here is done.
