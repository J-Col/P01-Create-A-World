          With your powers of the world you begin to flaten and fosture the land
          leading away from the coast. The land molds and bends at your will,
          creating a flat land that provides ample territory to expand into.
          The people of the village are scared at first but slowly realize this
          mysterious power doesn't seem to want to hurt them. The people
          tentatively explore this new land, setting up simple teepees as they
          go.
