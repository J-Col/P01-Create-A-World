          You teach the village of a basic social system where the woman owns
          the home and all possessions. The man is the worker and it is his
          job to provide for the family. The villagers seems to accept this system
          and offer the first house to the oldest woman in the village. The villagers
          must now find a way to make group decisions when both men and women are
          involved.
