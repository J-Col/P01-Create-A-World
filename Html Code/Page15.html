          The farmers of the village ask you to give them the knowledge to farm
          better crops for the village. After a brief moment you decide to give
          them the information on the three sisters. The farmers immediately begin
          to plant corn, squash, and beans over everthing else. They fill the
          fields with rows upon rows of the sisters. There appears to be an issue
          however, the crops stopped yielding as much as they once did.
