      Cattle over Crops!

          The storm hits the village in the night. While everyone is asleep,
          the rains pour down onto the fields. The cattle have been moved into
          one of the houses for the night in an attempt to save them. The fields
          flood and wash away all the crops from the village. The following day
          the villagers are forced to slaughter a cow for food. It appears that
          the cow was infected with mad cow disease, and within a few months time
          the entire village has fallen ill. Three months later, only one villager
          remains, he damns you for your choice and dies later that night.
