          In their attempts to explore new foods and ways of living, the village
          decides to try new sea foods. They eat new creatures that they can
          find in the sea, new fish, crustaceans, and other animals. They
          accidentaly eat a pufferfish, and the village falls sick. It doesn't
          take long for most the village to fall to the poison. The remaining
          members are too afraid to eat from the sea again, but don't know any
          other way of living. They soon die off from starvation.
