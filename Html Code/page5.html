          You imbue the builders of the village with basic woodcutting and building
          techniques that allow them to create simple huts. They use strong slices
          of wood from the nearby forests and sharp rocks to create axes. They set
          out to chop trees to gather wood. After many hours of work they have
          created a new house in the center of the village that is comprised of
          logs with indents cut in the ends to stack on one another. There appears
          to be unrest between the members however over who gets to live in the
          cabin.
