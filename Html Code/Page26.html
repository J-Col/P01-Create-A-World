          The villagers all load on to two boats, enough supplies to last five
          years at sea. They travel with the winds and the current of the ocean,
          with no knowledge of the ocean they are at the complete mercy of
          nature. Three years into their expidition, they stumble upon a coast
          line. They are greeted by what appears to be another group of people.
          They merge together to form a nation and prosper.
