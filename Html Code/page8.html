          The large field of vegetation has attracted a herd of cattle to the
          settlement. The villagers managed to trap them but don't know what to <!DOCTYPE html>
          with them. You give them the most basic understanding of raising
          livestock in an attempt to further their developmnet. This new knowledge
          drives them to create pens for the cows and herd them inside, away from
          their farm lands. A strong storm is approaching, the villagers look to you
          for guidance. Do they save the cattle or the crops?
