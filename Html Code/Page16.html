          The sect of the village that was unhappy with the system in place makes
          its move during the night. They abduct the leaders of the village and
          leave them deep in the forest with their arms tied and blindfolded. When
          they return to the village they take control of the political system.
          In fear of others looking to change the system and asking you for your
          help, they shun you from the village and destroy all record of your ever
          having been there.
