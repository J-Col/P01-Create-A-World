          You teach the farmers of the village the method of crop rotation.
          Where they alternate which crops they are farming based on the previous
          harvest. This leads them to become even more prosperous. The village
          flourishes, and soon is expanding even more. They are on the track to
          become a well established nation soon. You take a step back, smile,
          and realize your work here is done. They have been given the tools to
          succeed, now they must use them.
