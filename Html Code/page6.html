          You imbue the hardest working of the village with the knowledge of the
          simplest forms of agricuture. They begin to create hoes with sticks and
          rocks and plow fields in rudimentary fashion. The women scavenge for seeds
          from the surrounding forests while the men are at work. They appear to
          have allocated nearly half their available land to the fields.
